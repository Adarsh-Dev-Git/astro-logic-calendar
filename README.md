# Chronomancer üéØ


## Basic Details

### Project Description
Chronomancer is a satirical calendar application that serves as a beautiful parody of modern productivity culture. It completely ignores user availability, logic, and convenience. Instead, it harnesses the "power" of the cosmos, using real-time astrological data to schedule your events at the most auspicious‚Äîor hilariously inopportune‚Äîmoments. It‚Äôs not a productivity tool; it's a productivity performance¬†art¬†piece.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Modern productivty tools suffer from an overemphasis on rationality, user convenience and time management efficiency.Chronomancer corrects this by re introducing cosmic unpredictability, ensuring your schedule is fully aligned with - or disastrously opposed to - the movements of celestial¬†bodies.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
How We‚Äôre Solving It :
We replace boring, logical scheduling with cosmically-powered chaos:
Gather your birth data for ‚Äúmaximum accuracy.‚Äù
Auspicious Scheduling Engine‚Ñ¢ picks hilariously inconvenient astrological times.
Chaos Mode finds the worst possible moment for your event.
Conflicting events battle in a Cosmic Showdown.
Astrological Excuses justify everything to your boss or friends.
Maman Mode‚Ñ¢ adds sarcastic uncle commentary.

Result: A sleek, professional calendar that‚Äôs beautifully useless and perfectly aligned (or misaligned) with¬†the¬†cosmos.
